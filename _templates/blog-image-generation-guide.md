# Blog Post Image Generation Guide

## Overview
This document provides prompts and summaries for generating visual thumbnails for each blog post in the PromptNotes blog. The images should follow Christopher Olah's style: clean, technical, diagrammatic, and visually informative.

## Image Generation Guidelines

### Style Requirements
- **Clean and minimal**: Simple geometric shapes, clear lines
- **Technical aesthetic**: Diagrams, flowcharts, network visualizations
- **Color palette**: Muted colors (blues, grays, subtle accent colors)
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts
- **Composition**: Centered, balanced layouts
- **Size**: 400x200 pixels (2:1 aspect ratio)

### Content Requirements
- **Visual metaphors**: Represent the core concept visually
- **Technical elements**: Include relevant technical symbols or diagrams
- **Clear hierarchy**: Main concept prominently displayed
- **Professional appearance**: Suitable for technical blog

## Blog Post Summaries and Image Prompts

### 1. "Why Hollywood's AI Revolution Is Stuck in the Render Queue"

**Summary:** This post discusses the infrastructure gap between AI demos and production pipelines. It explains how AI tools work in isolation but fail to integrate into complex VFX workflows, proposing modular pipeline architecture as a solution.

**Image Prompt:**
```
blue rectangular blocks connected by arrows, pipeline diagram, minimalist, clean lines, technical illustration, flat design, white background, geometric shapes, systematic workflow, infrastructure visualization
```

### 2. "Stop Hiring 'AI Artists' â€” You Need AI Translators"

**Summary:** This post addresses communication breakdowns between creative and technical teams in VFX studios. It introduces the concept of "AI Translators" - professionals who can bridge the gap between artistic intent and technical implementation.

**Image Prompt:**
```
three circles connected by lines, communication diagram, purple and blue tones, minimalist, clean design, team collaboration, translation symbols, flat illustration, white background, geometric connections
```

### 3. "Building a Temporal Coherence Pipeline That Producers Understand"

**Summary:** This post explains temporal coherence algorithms in business terms, showing how maintaining consistency across frames saves 40% on artist time and reduces client revisions by 60%.

**Image Prompt:**
```
six rectangular frames in sequence, video timeline, green tones, temporal flow, minimalist, clean lines, frame consistency, flat design, white background, geometric progression
```

### 4. "The Visual Language of AI: How Computer Vision Translates to VFX Production"

**Summary:** This post explains how AI processes visual information through structured pipelines, breaking down the computer vision process into understandable stages for VFX professionals.

**Image Prompt:**
```
four rectangular modules with arrows, computer vision pipeline, orange tones, data processing, minimalist, clean lines, technical diagram, flat design, white background, systematic workflow
```

### 5. "The AI Brain: How Intelligence Processes Visual Data in VFX Production"

**Summary:** This post explores how AI neural networks process visual information, explaining the internal workings of AI systems and how they relate to VFX production workflows.

**Image Prompt:**
```
central circle with radiating connections, neural network diagram, teal tones, brain processing, minimalist, clean lines, node connections, flat design, white background, geometric network
```

## Additional Image Prompts for Future Posts

### 6. "The $100K Question: Build vs. Buy Your AI Pipeline"

**Image Prompt:**
```
Create a visual comparison diagram showing "Build vs. Buy" decision framework. Use two distinct sections or columns with different visual treatments. One side could use geometric, modular shapes suggesting "building" or "construction." The other side could use more polished, complete shapes suggesting "buying" or "ready-made solutions." Use contrasting but complementary colors (perhaps blue and green tones). Include small decision elements or comparison symbols. Clean, minimal design with no text overlays.
```

### 7. "Your Client Doesn't Care About Your Diffusion Model"

**Image Prompt:**
```
Create a visual representation of client focus vs. technical details. Use a large, prominent element representing "client value" or "business results" in warm tones, with smaller, secondary technical elements (like mathematical symbols or technical diagrams) in muted tones. The composition should emphasize the main business value while showing technical elements as supporting details. Clean, minimal design focusing on visual hierarchy.
```

### 8. "The API Nobody Asked For (But Everyone Needs)"

**Image Prompt:**
```
Create a technical diagram showing API integration and middleware. Use geometric shapes representing different systems or applications, with connecting elements (APIs) between them. Use neutral tones (grays, blues) with accent colors for the connecting elements. Include subtle technical symbols or integration patterns. The design should suggest "connectivity," "integration," and "system architecture."
```

## Usage Instructions

### For ChatGPT/DALL-E:
1. Copy the specific image prompt for the blog post you want to create an image for
2. Paste it into your AI image generation tool
3. Specify the exact dimensions: 400x200 pixels
4. Request the image in a format suitable for web use (PNG or SVG)
5. Ensure the image follows the clean, technical aesthetic described

### For Manual Creation:
1. Use the prompts as inspiration for creating diagrams in tools like:
   - Figma
   - Adobe Illustrator
   - Canva
   - Draw.io
2. Follow the color palette and style guidelines
3. Focus on geometric shapes and clean lines
4. Avoid text overlays - let the visual elements tell the story
